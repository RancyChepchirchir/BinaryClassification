# BinaryClassification

To increase recognition ability in classification problem, we will remove outlier entries as well as redundant and unnecessary features from training set. Filtering and feature selection can have large impact on classifier accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), as noisy data negatively impacts on the classifier and lead it to catch wrong patterns in training data. The common approach in data filtering is using proximity graphs. However, the problem of the optimal filtering parameters selection is still insufficiently researched. In this paper filtering procedure based on k-nearest neighbours proximity graph was used. Filtering parameters selection was adopted as the solution of outlier minimization problem: k-NN proximity graph, power of distance and threshold parameters are selected in order to minimize outlier percentage in training data. Finally, the performance of four commonly used classifiers (Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) are analyzed. 

Dynamic ensemble selection (DES) systems work by estimating the level of competence of each classifier from a pool of classifiers, with only the most competent ones being selected to classify a given test sample. This is achieved by defining a criterion to measure the level of competence of base classifiers, such as, its accuracy. But filtering doesnâ€™t have sufficient impact on DES-LA performance while working with high-accuracy datasets.
